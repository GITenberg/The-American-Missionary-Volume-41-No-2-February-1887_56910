<h2>American Missionary Association.</h2>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>We remind our readers that the National Council and the annual
meeting have placed before us a high mark in asking from the
churches $350,000 the current year. That sixty per cent. advance
upon the contributions of last year will not be made without the
consciously directed efforts of our friends to secure it. We
are happy to announce that quite a number of the churches whose
contributions have been taken since the annual meeting have made
the advance, some of them reaching even a hundred per cent, over
the contributions of the preceding year. Let the matter be brought
to the attention of the churches and kept before them, and they
will rise to the occasion. They have both the means and the
disposition.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Can you do anything to increase the list of subscribers for
<span class="smcap">The American Missionary</span>? That is one way in which you
might help us. Every mail brings voluntary testimonials of the
high esteem in which our magazine is held by its readers. We could
easily fill our pages with extracts. The subscription price is so
low—fifty cents—that we cannot offer premiums or make reduction
for clubs. We do ask, however, for a greatly enlarged increase in
subscriptions on the purely business ground that the magazine is
worth the subscription price, and more, too. Can you do anything to
help us in this direction?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An Example.—Rev. A.&nbsp;F. Newton, of Marlboro, Mass., one Sunday in
last December preached to his people on Christian Reading in the
home. He circulated among the congregation a list of the missionary
magazines and religious papers which, in his judgment, ought to
have a place in every family. <span class="smcap">The American Missionary</span>,
of course, was among the number. We presume that other ministers
have done substantially the same, but knowledge of Mr. Newton’s
effort having come to us, we take occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> to specially mention
it. Our conviction is strong that if all our pastors were to go
and do likewise, there would be a great increase in the number of
our subscribers, and during the year corresponding increase in
contributions, sympathy and prayer for our work. We commend the
example of Mr. Newton to the brethren.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We regret to say that Rev. J.&nbsp;L. Withrow, D.D., has, in consequence
of his call to Chicago, sent in his resignation as a member of our
Executive Committee, a position that he has held since 1883. Our
churches ought to know Dr. Withrow’s fidelity. Once a month he
made the journey from Boston to New York in order to attend the
meetings. It was very rarely that he was absent. Our good wishes
and prayers accompany him into his new field in the West.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The vacancy thus made has been filled by the Executive Committee
in the unanimous election of Rev. Jas. W. Cooper, D.D., New
Britain, Conn. Dr. Cooper has kindly consented to serve. He is not
a man willing to accept a position as a mere figure-head, and the
churches may be assured that the interests of the Association will
be faithfully served by him. He is a man of business and executive
ability in a marked degree, and we shall welcome his counsel and
wisdom in the administration of the Association’s affairs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Thomasville (Ga.) <cite>Times</cite> speaks very commendatorially of the
American Missionary Association’s work in Thomasville. It refers
with evident pleasure to the erection of our building for the
Connecticut Industrial School, and speaks of our missionaries who
are now carrying on the school in temporary quarters until the new
building is completed, as follows: “These ladies are engaged in a
work which commends itself to all classes of our citizens. They
will receive, as they should, every encouragement and courtesy at
the hands of the people of Thomasville.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They had a good time at Fisk University, Thanksgiving Day. Sermon
by Prof. Bennett in the forenoon, athletic sports on the campus
in the afternoon, and a praise meeting in charge of Pres. Cravath
in the evening. Dr. Cravath spoke of the university as a family
in connection with the thought that family reunions were the
characteristic form of observing the Thanksgiving anniversary.
Testimony of personal reasons for thankfulness were given both by
teachers and students. One was thankful that after having been
twelve years in the university he had at length been led to give
himself to the Lord; another, a newcomer, that the way had been
opened for him to come to Fisk, where he had been received as a
child into the family; some for hardships and trials endured,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span> others for what Fisk University had been to them and had done for
them. A very fitting and enjoyable observance of the day this was,
certainly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are 8,000 liquor saloons in the city of New York. Last year
they paid for licenses $600,000. This money, strange to say, is
divided up among charitable and reform institutions in the city.
Saloon keepers pay $600,000 for protection by law, while they carry
shame, sorrow and ruin to tens of thousands of their fellow-beings.
Surely the American Missionary Association ought to receive the
$350,000 asked from the churches, as it tries to carry the Gospel
to twelve millions of the most neglected and ignorant of our
American population.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
</div>

<div class="article">
<h3>OUR ROLL OF HONOR.</h3>

<p>According to custom, we publish this month a list of our mission
stations and the names of the missionaries. It furnishes a fruitful
field in which to glean valuable information. A glance at it shows
the magnitude of our work. There are 215 stations, in charge of
422 workers. Each station is a centre at which mission work is
organized for all the region round about. To him who scans it
carefully the list reveals the variety of the work. It is both
evangelistic and educational. Church planting and building;
Sunday-school work; primary, normal, industrial, collegiate and
professional training, are all represented, because the people need
to be instructed in everything secular, social and religious, that
pertains to civilized life and well-ordered society.</p>

<p>If facts and incidents in the lives of individual missionaries and
in the development of work at specified points are ascertained
(consult back numbers of <span class="smcap">The American Missionary</span>) and
brought into the public meeting, interest cannot fail to be
awakened; nor will the interest be evanescent; it will go home with
the people; it will stay with them; it will secure a place in their
thought and prayer; it will get into the contribution box; it will
reach the field.</p>

<p>Some of the stations, by reason of special agencies, as, for
example, Fisk University, have become well known; but for the
greater part they are indefinitely thought of in the mass. The same
is true of the missionaries. Only a few of them are widely known.
Yet in their isolation, bearing obloquy and reproach for their
work’s sake, misjudged as to their character and mission, even by
Christian ministers and church members who keep aloof from their
acquaintance and fellowship, it is natural that they should crave
the expressed sympathy of those they represent. It would lighten
their burdens and brighten their path to feel that they are known
and remembered by name in the churches at home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>There is one thing to be noted which a mere study of the list does
not reveal, and that is: our missionaries are a very happy band.
Despite the discouragements and trials incident to their work,
they are neither cast down nor discouraged. On this point their
testimony is strong and continuous. They have the joy of their
Lord’s presence and the sustaining power of His almighty grace. “I
will never leave thee, nor forsake thee,” has become the gladsome
song of their hearts.</p>

<p>They are happy, too, in the knowledge that they have so many
friends and such generous supporters. The fact that the list of
their names is so long proves to them that their work has taken a
large hold upon the churches. The fact that contributions come from
so many churches and individuals, in amount sufficient to maintain
so great a work as the Association is carrying forward, is a
demonstration that they have the love and hearty support of tens of
thousands, some of whom make large sacrifices to contribute as they
do. They know that there are thousands who eloquently plead their
cause and defend their good name before the public, and on bended
knee remember them and their work at the Throne of Grace.</p>

<p>They are happy, also, in the knowledge that they are loved and
honored by those for whom they labor. Father Riggs was almost
worshipped by the Indians who knew him. E.&nbsp;A. Ware is a sainted
name that thousands of colored people, young and old, are ready
to rise up and honor, and whose very mention is an inspiration in
their hearing.</p>

<p>We recall to our readers words spoken by Prof. W.&nbsp;A. Crogman,
himself a fine specimen of the Christian scholar and thinker such
as his race is capable of producing under Christian training. We
quote from an address he made two years ago Thanksgiving Day,
before the Atlanta University, of which school he is a graduate:
“If I were asked to-day what one thing since the close of the war
has contributed most to the permanent prosperity of the South, I
unhesitatingly answer, Christian charity. When the victorious army
of the North was passing in review before President Johnson in the
streets of Washington, another army, vastly inferior in numbers,
imbued with a different spirit, and armed with no other weapons
than the Bible and the spelling-book, was marching under the eye
of God down into this very field from which Grant and Sherman had
but recently withdrawn. Silently came they into the field. There
was no heralding of their approach, no display. Hopefully came they
into the field, notwithstanding they knew that to the majority of
the people their presence would be obnoxious. They came with faith
in God and love for man. They came, impelled by Christian duty and
patriotism, to wage a new war against the more deadly enemies of
the Republic—ignorance and vice. I am thankful to-day for the pen
of Lincoln and for the sword of Grant, but more thankful, by far,
for the patient ‘schoolma’am’ who taught the negro his letters and
set a million of us to reading.”</p>

<p>Let our Roll of Honor be studied, and let its history and memory
be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span> made known among the churches. It is abundantly worthy, and in
results will repay with rich reward.</p>

<p>“While practicing law a number of years ago,” says Judge Tourgee,
“I had a peculiar will case. An old lady who was a slaveholder,
dying, bequeathed her colored man, John, and her dusky maid, Jane,
who sustained to each other the relation of husband and wife, to
the trustees of the church, to be used as far as possible for the
‘glory of God.’ I was curious to know what course was taken, and
upon investigation found that, after meditation and prayer, the
pious trustees sold their living legacy at auction, and with the
proceeds sent a missionary to China.”</p>

<p>The New England Society of New York celebrated Forefathers’ Day
December 22d. There was one feature of this anniversary of special
interest to the readers of the <span class="smcap">Missionary</span>. It was a speech
by Mr. H.&nbsp;W. Grady, editor of the Atlanta <cite>Constitution</cite>. Mr. Grady
is a representative Southerner of the progressive type. His theme
was The New South, and he handled it in such a way as to elicit
the heartiest applause and the warmest commendation from those who
heard him. Of course he could not speak on such a theme without
having a good deal to say about the negro. We give the following
extracts:</p>

<p>“But what is the sum of our work? We have found out that in the
general summing up the free negro counts more than he did as a
slave. We have planted the schoolhouse on the hill-top and made it
free to white and black.”</p>

<p>“The relations of the Southern people with the negro are close and
cordial. We remember with what fidelity for four years he guarded
our defenseless women and children, whose husbands and fathers were
fighting against his freedom. To his eternal credit be it said that
whenever he struck a blow for his own liberty he fought in open
battle, and when at last he raised his black and humble hands that
the shackles might be struck off, those hands were innocent of
wrong against his helpless charges and worthy to be taken in loving
grasp by every man who honors loyalty and devotion.”</p>

<p>“But have we solved the problem he presents or progressed in honor
and equity towards its solution? Let the record speak to this
point. No section shows a more prosperous laboring population
than the negroes of the South, none in fuller sympathy with the
employing and land-owning class. He shares our school fund, has the
fullest protection of our laws and the friendship of our people.
Self-interest as well as honor demand that he should have this.
Our future, our very existence, depend upon our working out this
problem in full and exact justice. We understand that when Lincoln
signed the emancipation proclamation, your victory was assured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
for he then committed you to the cause of human liberty against
which the arms of man cannot prevail, while those of our statesmen
who made slavery the corner-stone of the Confederacy, doomed us to
defeat, committing us to a cause that reason could not defend or
the sword maintain in the light of advancing civilization.”</p>

<p>“We fought hard enough to know that we were whipped, and in perfect
frankness accepted as final the arbitrament of the sword to which
we had appealed. The South found her jewel in a toad’s head. The
shackles that had held her in narrow limitations fell forever when
the shackles of the negro slave were broken. Under the old régime
the negroes were slaves to the South, the South was a slave to the
system. Thus was gathered in the hands of a splendid and chivalric
oligarchy the substance that should have been diffused among the
people, as the rich blood is gathered at the heart, filling that
with affluent rapture, but leaving the body chill and colorless.”</p>

<p>When Mr. Grady said, “We have planted the school house on the
hill-top and made it free to white and black,” he must have had in
mind the Atlanta University, for he knows all about that school.
The $8,000 a year appropriated from the State justly entitles the
Georgians to regard Atlanta University as a State school. But
whence comes the money necessary to supplement this appropriation,
to meet current expenses? Whence came the $150,000, and more, that
have gone into the fine grounds, buildings and equipments? From
New Englanders and children of New Englanders in the West, through
the American Missionary Association. Mr. Grady must have known
these facts. He knew that New England brains conceived the school,
that New England money planted it, that New Englanders have always
been, and are, its teachers, what sacrifices they have made, what
social ostracism endured, what splendid work they have done and
are doing. He knows from personal inspection the superiority of
that school, and that this superiority has frequently been spoken
of in the columns of the able paper of which he is the editor. He
knows that the munificent funds bearing the names of Slater and
Peabody were given by New Englanders. All these things, and more
in the same direction, Mr. Grady knows, and yet in the presence
of New Englanders and in the city where are the headquarters of
the American Missionary Association, he did not make the faintest
reference in recognition. It is said his speech was extemporaneous.
Nevertheless was it not unfortunate that upon such an occasion he
failed to give honor to whom honor is due?</p>

<div class="article">
<p>The Freedmen’s Aid Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church
recently opened a University for white students in Chattanooga,
Tenn. Some colored students applied for admission. They were
refused, but this was not the end. A colored minister, Rev. B.
H. Johnson, pastor of one of the Methodist Episcopal Churches of
Chattanooga, meeting Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>  Caulkins of the university in
a store, offered him his hand, but as it was a black hand the
professor would not accept it. That would have been a recognition
of “social equality.” The colored brother felt, and felt justly,
that he had been insulted. When knowledge of the insult reached the
Executive Committee of the Freedmen’s Aid Society, whose funds in
large part built and support the university, steps were immediately
taken to learn the exact facts in the case. They moved cautiously
and wisely, that no wrong should be done and that no unjust
judgment should be pronounced, and when they had made a thorough
examination of the whole case, heard from both sides and from all
sides, they voted that through the trustees of the university the
professor be asked to resign at once. The Executive Committee
has done right and should have the cordial backing of the entire
Methodist Church. A mistake was made when the colored students were
refused admission. No matter if they were hired by wicked white men
to go and force the issue. All the more should an issue be met when
forced by such people. Better that a millstone be hanged around the
neck of the institution and that it be drowned in the midst of the
sea than that it be made an occasion of offense to one of Christ’s
little ones. Christ is in the world in the person of these little
ones, and he who insults them insults <em>Him</em>, and he who insults Him
insults all who love Him.</p>

<p>We take the following extracts from a letter received by Dr.
Strieby from our good friend, Mr. Robert Arthington, of Leeds,
England. As a little mirror, showing “ourselves as ithers see
us,” it has special significance. We have often thought that
the indifference of the Christian people of this country to the
question of the salvation of the Indians was a sad spectacle for
our brethren in other lands to look upon. Would that the churches
might be made to feel this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Dr. Strieby</span>—I trust the ‘missionary laugh’
will, by the great mercy of God, ‘never come on the air by my
side.’ Oh, that it might be so with all real Christians.</p>

<p>“In the November <span class="smcap">Missionary</span> the Indians are mentioned.
I am at this moment intensely desirous that the Indians of
the South American continent should be reached by the Gospel
message. This appears to me to be very difficult, sadly, sadly
difficult. But the case in the North American continent seems
to me to be altogether different. There, as it regards your
part, is a government, and a people, which and who approve of
all men’s reading the Christian Scriptures. Grand, glorious, if
only they would be more practical. Why does not the Government
at once solve the problem by sending persons well fitted for
the purpose to teach each tribe to read? Then when they can
read, the American Bible Society might introduce extensively
to the whole of the Indian tribes in the United States the
inestimably precious word of God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“For goodness’ sake, if not for God’s sake, O, Americans, arise
and do this necessary thing. There is no time to be lost. You
have “heaped teachers” to yourselves, and you leave these poor
men and women, as worthy as yourselves, except real Christians,
to their darkness, devoid of the light, joy and infinite good
beyond description of a personal intimate knowledge of the
sacred Christian Scriptures.”</p></div>

<h3>NOTES IN THE SADDLE.</h3>

<p class="secauth">BY FIELD-SUPERINTENDENT C. J. RYDER.</p>

<p>The romantic, pathetic and comical jumble themselves together in
a strange medley in these field experiences. But each experience
illustrates some phase in missionary work, or italicizes its
importance. We drop into a mountain cabin and there find the
usual inmates of such mountain homes—a pale-faced, tired-looking
woman, with the “old woman in the shoe” sort of family. The oldest
of the children is a girl of eighteen. She informs us, during a
conversation, that she “<em>has never seen a book</em>.” She modifies this
statement a bit by adding: “I ’low thayr war one ’fore grandmam
died, but I plumb forgot how it looked.” Think of it! A girl
eighteen years old, in the heart of this country, which boasts
itself in its educational advantages, who did not know what a book
looked like! What more pathetic appeal can be offered in behalf of
this mountain work than this fact presents?</p>

<p>The ignorance of the preachers is often as painfully evident as
that of the people. A friend residing in this region told me that
he had often been asked by the preacher to read his text for him
at the church service, the preacher adding: “I thank God I cannot
read; the Spirit teaches me.” This preacher was white.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here is a case of genuine civil service reform: A member of an A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.
church was requested by the committee of his party to run
for Congress. He declined unless they would pledge themselves that
no money nor <em>whiskey</em> should be used to influence voters. The
committee replied that this could not be done, as it would lose
them the election. “Very well,” said this mountain nobleman, “then
you must get another candidate.” In speaking of the circumstance
to this friend, I told him that all his friends rejoiced in the
stand he had taken, and that the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span> appreciated the honor
he had conferred upon it by his loyalty to political honesty, but
that the country needed such men in Congress as he was. He laid
his hand on my shoulder and replied: “It was no great sacrifice; I
really believe I would rather go to a good prayer-meeting than to
Congress.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We jog along and come to a little slab meeting-house, just built
at considerable self-denial and persistent begging on the part of
a few colored Christians. An old brother was called upon to pray
at the opening of the service. This was one sentence in his quaint
prayer: “Oh, Lord, bless our brother, and give him a pennyroyal
tongue.” But it is not so foolish a petition, after all. Pennyroyal
is an herb growing abundantly in that region, and is used for
ointments and salves; it is healing, it soothes irritations, heals
old hurts, reduces inflammations. That is the sort of a tongue a
missionary superintendent needs. I fancy, also, many pastors would
sometimes rejoice in the possession of such a tongue. I doubt if
our colored brother could read, but he had in some way learned
Solomon’s secret: “The tongue of the wise is health.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. has no school now at Louisville, Ky., but the pastor
and lady missionary wisely plan for the instruction of those who
do not enjoy school privileges. Coming in upon them one Saturday
afternoon, I found a motley group of children, ranging from six
to sixteen years of age, gathered in the Sunday-school room of
the church. I learned that it was the Industrial Class, which met
regularly twice a week. In a little closet in one corner all sorts
of second-hand clothing were stored. These garments are sent down
by good people of the North, and are made over in this Industrial
class. While the children were busy in cutting, fitting and sewing,
their teacher gave them useful lessons in Bible texts and truths;
sensible suggestions for every-day life, or rudimentary lessons
in arithmetic, geography and grammar. To many in these classes
this instruction is all they get during the year, and no one can
estimate its value. Indeed, the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. churches are usually a
sort of information bureau to the congregations.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The pastor of one church which I recently visited said to his
people: “Some of you cannot read; all of you are very busy and find
it difficult to get time to read; so I have concluded to give you a
brief review of the week’s news each Sabbath evening.” He then read
a summary of events relating to education, temperance, religion and
politics. Thus these churches are training the people to a wise
exercise of their citizenship.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The three theological students from Fisk University who were
ordained at the State Association in Nashville, in November, find
ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> opportunity to prove “their calling” by preaching in the
church at Goodlettsville. This church was organized last year, and
has not yet secured a settled pastor.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Rev. John Kershaw, who was recently appointed General Missionary
of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. in the Cumberland Mountains, reports twenty-one
hopeful conversions as the result of a series of meetings held
by himself and Bro. Barton, of Robbins. So the work goes forward
encouragingly in Scott County. The large army of men who poured
into this region during the construction of the Cincinnati
Southern R.&nbsp;R., have moved on. The vast number of drinking places
this unsettled multitude created a demand for has been greatly
reduced. Society has settled to its normal condition. <em>Now is
our opportunity.</em> Let us plant churches, strengthen and multiply
Sunday-schools, establish Christian schools, and thus keep out
saloons and places of evil resort. It is always easier to keep the
devil out than to get him out.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Many of our A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Sunday-schools are rejoicing in new libraries,
the gifts of the “Congregational S.&nbsp;S. and Publishing Society,” and
the “Western Tract and Book Society.” The thoughtful Secretaries of
these societies have the hearty thanks of the field workers.</p>

<h3>CHRISTMAS AT McINTOSH, GA.</h3>

<p>Christmas came at the end of a series of revival services which
have been held here with encouraging results, some forty young
people professing to find Christ precious to their souls, a number
of whom will be after due care and examination received into church
membership. The members, too, have been cheered and helped in their
Christian life, and have resolved to be more fully consecrated
to God’s service. We commenced the day with a short service at
6:30 a.m., when we had a little talk on the topic, “The Birth of
Christ.” At 9 o’clock the schoolchildren assembled with parents
and friends to the number of four-hundred or more, to undertake
their exercises, which were very satisfactory, doing great credit
to the teachers. Hymns appropriate for the occasion were gone
through admirably in the church, which had been gaily decorated
with evergreens, palmetto grass, redberries and moss, the Christmas
tree being a most conspicuous object, heavily laden with all kinds
of good things. The distribution of the various articles followed,
and all, both young and old, received a gift. They then turned
out, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</i>, after singing “Praise God from whom all blessings
flow,” into the school grounds, where their happiness reached its
height, the people witnessing some good old fashioned English games
undertaken by the boys, including flat-race, three-legged race and
sack-racing, (which caused no end of merriment) running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span> high leap
and pole-leaping. The girls, too, were delightfully entertained
by the teachers’ partaking in corresponding games, which were
enhanced by the strains from the brass band in attendance. Later
in the afternoon fourteen persons, including Rev. Floyd Snelson,
the teachers, and others, started upon an eight-mile drive. A halt
was made at McIntosh proper, where holiday festivities were being
indulged in by a large number, I am sorry to say, to the detriment
of all present. Whilst waiting to give the horses rest, it was
plain to be seen that whiskey had been freely partaken of both by
male and female, and a disturbance arose in which we could see from
the distance the excited people fighting, the women taking the most
prominent part. At another settlement on the other side of us, we
heard there had been disturbances mainly caused by the “fire-water”
drinkers. As I stood looking on, I could not but thank God for the
contrast, so plainly set before me in the day’s proceedings, and
to bless God for the work and workers, whose influence is at least
felt for miles around, both among old and young, whom they have
under their training. I cannot speak too highly of the teachers
here, although my acquaintance with them has only been of three
weeks’ duration; yet travelling about as I do both in England and
America I have learned to form some idea of work in my Master’s
cause, and say that the work here is worthy of the sympathy and
prayers of all God’s children, on both sides of the water, on
behalf of these once downtrodden sons of Africa.</p>

<p>Miss Plimpton has in her class-room 72 scholars, Miss Robertson
74 and Miss Dox 84, Miss Cutler taking the responsibility in a
great measure of the household duties. They are taxed to the very
utmost of their strength and have turned away between fifty and
sixty children, who would gladly walk many miles each day, if they
could be accommodated. The Bible readings at some of the sisters’
houses, held twice a week, and also the Bible instruction and
society meetings which are held at the teachers’ home, are all
undertaken after school hours, so that an idea can be formed as
to the exceedingly heavy task bearing upon them, but the promise
is still as certain to-day as of old, “As thy day so shall thy
strength be.” Towards sun-down the young folks began to scatter to
their respective homes, everybody seeming to be delighted with the
day’s proceedings, and wishing in their hearts that Christmas day
came once a month.</p>

<h3>FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF SANTEE.</h3>

<p class="secauth">BY MISS EDITH LEONARD.</p>

<p>An outside view of any community is always different from an inside
view, yet both may be true. I am going to try to give you some of
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span> impressions I received of the Santee school, during the first
days that I spent here, before I began to feel that I was a part of
it.</p>

<p>The teachers and scholars were just returning after vacation. The
teachers seemed especially happy in meeting the scholars and one
another, and beginning work again. I had never known a company of
people with so much care who seemed so light hearted and hopeful,
and I thought “They love their work.”</p>

<p>The boys and girls seemed happy, too, and when I looked at their
faces in the chapel and met them later in the home and school, I
found in many of them a gentleness and frankness, a trustfulness
and willingness to be taught, that surprised me. I had looked for
less of these qualities than in white children, but I found more
than would be found in most white schools.</p>

<p>Their reverence and attention in church, too, was in striking
contrast with what I have seen in many places where the children
seem to take no part in the worship. These children always take
the attitude of devotion during prayer, and sit quietly and
with serious demeanor through three or four services on Sunday.
They seem to enjoy it, too, even when there is a part that they
imperfectly understand, on account of the use of two languages in
these services. They love Bible stories and hymns, and accept what
they are taught concerning religious things, with a simplicity that
I have been used to finding only in the youngest. Perhaps it is
because they are so shut in by themselves here. They know little
of the indifference or half concealed hostility to religious truth
that is so common in larger communities, even among those who
attend church regularly.</p>

<p>During the first weeks here, while our windows were constantly
open, I was struck by the amount of singing I heard. From more
than one of the houses where the scholars live I could hear the
hymn sung at morning prayers; then came the voices of the school
in their opening exercises, and later of the music classes. Beside
this we often heard the boys and girls singing in recreation hours
for pleasure, and again at night before retiring, their evening
hymn. The sacred words and the young voices could not fail to bring
good thoughts, and I was reminded of Luther’s saying, “The devil
always flies from music, especially sacred music, because he is a
gloomy spirit, and cannot bear joy and gladness.”</p>

<p>I am conscious that after three months here I see many things in a
different light from that in which I first saw them. I have learned
that there are some peculiar hindrances to teaching the Indians,
so that it is by no means always easy. I have learned, also, that
the teachers, with all their happiness in their work, see enough
of sickness and ignorance and evil many times to make their hearts
ache.</p>

<p>Yet the cheerful view I received at first was not a false one.
There is more to make one sad here than in many other places, but
there is also much to make one glad. There is the constant contact
with young life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> the opportunity to see how much the every-day
blessings of home and school are worth to those who have not had
them, the sympathy that comes from a common purpose frankly avowed,
and in addition there are abundant opportunities and favorable
conditions for teaching these boys and girls to love Christ, and to
feel concerning themselves,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“He’s fitting us to enter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into His service sweet.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I think nearly all who are here, both teachers and scholars,
feel that this lonely little cluster of buildings away off on an
Indian reservation, is, for them, one of the best places the earth
contains.</p>

<h2>THE CHINESE.</h2>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="secauth">BY REV. W.&nbsp;C. POND.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are
many adversaries.”—1 <i>Cor</i>., xvi, 9.</p></div>

<p>What Paul experienced at Ephesus, we find to be true in our humble
work among the Chinese in California. We are grateful that the door
is open, and that it is as great and as effectual as it is. We
cannot deny that there are also “many adversaries.”</p>

<p>Our Chinese brethren think that some of these, among their
own countrymen, and even among the pupils in our schools, are
peculiarly annoying. Jee Gam was telling me, a few days since, of
an experience with one of these, which I asked him to write out for
the readers of <span class="smcap">The American Missionary</span>:</p>

<p>“Several months ago, while Mrs. Lamont, Gin Foo King and myself,
were busily engaged in teaching the other scholars at the Barnes
school, our attention was diverted by the voice of one who was not
studying, but talking aloud. He was a pompous fellow, who, though
he is only a servant, dresses like a very rich man. Working for $16
per month, he wears a purple figured silk coat and a gold bracelet.
He puts on the appearance, in the school-room, of high breeding and
great learning. As we listened to him, this is what we heard: ‘What
doctrine have the foreigners? They have no duty between Emperor
and officials, parents and children, elder and younger brother,
husband and wife, or even between friends; but we, Chinese, are
taught by our great sage, Confucius. His teaching on these duties
is above all that men ever taught on earth. The foreigner has not
the son of heaven (meaning the Emperor). When he is 21 years old
he leaves his home and thinks no more of his parents; not only so,
but leaves them to take care of themselves. The husband lends his
wife to his friends, who walk with her arm in arm on the street.
The way of courtship and marriage is like that of beasts. He knows
no politeness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span> no integrity, no modesty, and no shame; in fact,
all foreigners are barbarians. Confucius said: “I have heard of
barbarians becoming Chinese, but have never heard of Chinese
becoming barbarians.”’ He continued at length in that way. Gin Foo
King and I listened till patience failed us. ‘Where did you get
your knowledge about the foreigners?’ I asked. ‘What do you know of
the Bible?’ He gave no answer. ‘Who are these people that Confucius
called barbarians? Were they Americans, or English, or Germans?
Would you take your teacher, Mrs. Lamont, for a barbarian? Would
you claim that you are more enlightened than she?’ I then explained
to him that those whom Confucius called barbarians were people
within the Chinese Empire; his China was a small country, covering
only a few of the present central provinces, and all the people
outside that district were esteemed to be barbarians. There were
no Americans when he lived, and as to English and Germans, he knew
nothing about them. He did not call <em>them</em> barbarians.”</p>

<p>When the pupils heard this, they laughed at the pretentious
scholar. Since then he does not loudly and boastfully contend; at
least, in our presence; but I have reason to think that he works
against us privately. We pray for him, and we hope that God will
answer our prayers and open his eyes and change his heart, so that
he may see the beauty and the excellence there is in Christ.</p>

<p>Our brethren are justified in praying for such adversaries. Some
years ago one who had (for the sake of learning English) been very
constant at the Oakland school, on becoming a Christian confessed
that for months he had carried a pistol in his pocket, determined,
if he could with safety, to shoot Jee Gam because of his zeal
in leading his countrymen to Christ. We did not labor for that
“adversary” in vain.</p>

<p>Another was formerly a constant attendant at the Bethany school,
and a constant student of the New Testament. But it was in search
of material with which to counteract the influence of helpers and
teachers, and hold his fellow pupils firm to the ancestral faith.
Among other passages he came upon that one in Matt. ix, 17, which
speaks of the new wine in old bottles. It served his purpose
admirably. “China,” he said, “is an old bottle, very old; you must
not put this new doctrine into it; it will burst.” But Hong Sing,
who was then a member of this school, answered him well: “It is not
China that is old and weak, but our heathen customs of worshipping
ancestors and buying luck at the shrine of Joss, etc., etc. Put the
doctrine of Christ into these and it will burst them certainly; but
put it into China, and it will make her stronger and fairer than
ever.”</p>

<p>One Sunday evening, sitting in my study, preparing for our evening
service, while the Chinese Sunday-school was going on in an
adjoining room, I overheard some Chinaman vigorously exhorting the
pupils. I went out to see who it was. It was this “adversary.” I
asked what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span> was saying. “He is telling us,” a pupil replied,
“that he has found out that Jesus is the true God and only Saviour,
and asking us all to believe in Him.”</p>

<h3>A WEEK AT A NORMAL SCHOOL.</h3>

<p>A visitor at one of our normal schools in the South asked the
principal for a schedule of a week’s work, <em>outside</em> of the regular
school duties. The visitor reports this school to be equal to
Northern schools of the same grade and one where the aim is not
only to promote good scholarship but also to develop earnest and
intelligent Christian character.</p>

<p>In addition to this regular missionary work every week and every
day in the week, there are Temperance and Missionary meetings, the
preparation of Missionary letters and various incidental Christian
works. This school is a fair illustration of all.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="article">
<h3>HOW WE RAISED THE DEBT.</h3>

<p>Mother was East and father had gone to the Association at
Plankington. Only <em>Taute</em> was left to keep us straight. We had run
through the list and done most everything, except going swimming
and the pillow-fight. There were still several raw September days
to be disposed of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>Putting the play-room to rights one day, our throats just ached for
chocolate creams. We would make Taute pay so much a sight of the
play-room in apple-pie order. Taute would not be taxed, but would
like some jumping-jacks and nuns for her little Oahe girls, and we
could come by our chocolate creams honestly.</p>

<p>It would be hard to tell how it all came about, for one said one
thing and one another, until out of all the Babel and confusion we
decided on a fair, a real missionary fair. How our tongues wagged
while our fingers flew! How the jumping-jacks multiplied, and
the sedate little nuns came trooping forth each with prayer-book
and rosary, after whole families of pert-looking acorn dolls!
As by magic the bright bits of paper grew into kites, mats and
book-markers, and pen-wipers and pin-cushions; how could one have a
fair without them!</p>

<p>The day came at last. We had from Thursday evening until the next
Monday afternoon. (What a trying day Sunday was. Do you think it
was very, very wicked counting our jacks and nuns, and seeing how
much they would bring?)</p>

<p>The dining-room table Mamma let us have, and a string running
across the room made a splendid trapeze, where the nuns flirted
and danced with their jacks, the tea-kettles bubbled and the acorn
baskets turned somersaults. Oh! ’twas just shocking! And the acorn
dolls that kept watch over the fancy articles didn’t behave a bit
better. They bowed and curtseyed until their heads bobbed off. Even
the brave potato-man, who was marshal of the day, could scarcely
sit still on his potato-horse. Perhaps they felt good because they
were going to raise the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. debt.</p>

<p>And it was just as Mabel and Olive had said: Miss Haynes did buy a
jack and Miss Leonard a nun, and Miss Ilsley and Miss Pratt both
took dolls. Then those who had jacks wanted nuns and those who had
nuns must have jacks, and no one could resist the acorn dolls,
their heads rolled off so easily. Our buttonhole bouquets, too,
were just one cent, and little Ruthie Chadbourne’s papa and mamma
thought missionary candy very good for her, so they bought ever so
many little scallop-shells full at five cents apiece.</p>

<p>Miss Hunter, of Greenwood, was here, and had to buy out of
politeness, and when it was all over Mamma bought us out—that was,
we are quite sure, out of kindness. We had forgotten to say that
Father and Mother had come home. They had to come to help buy the
things, you see. Now that it is all over, we want you should know
what a happy time we had, and send you our pennies to raise the
debt with. Your friends and co-workers,</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
